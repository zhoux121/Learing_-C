I use pseudo-code as a direct point how is my code outprint looks like
like how many looping time I need and else stament I needed. But if I dont
use pseudo-code for coding It might still works but when the question become
harder I cant think with only using brain I might get worng if I dont pseudo it.

I used for loop and while. while is runing for I dont know how many time am I going to
enter a wrong number. for loop is runing as I knows how many days.

NO, I only spend less than 10 mins to finish works.
